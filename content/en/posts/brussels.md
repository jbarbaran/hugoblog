Due to a meeting at the European Commission for the review of a European research project I worked on (*SMEPP*), I had the opportunity to briefly visit Brussels, Belgium.  

I stayed at a hotel in Brussels' financial district. Its location was quite convenient, being close to *Gare du Nord* station and within a pleasant walking distance of the historic city center and the *Grand Place*.  

### A Glimpse of Life in Brussels  

During this visit and the meeting, which was held at the European Commission offices, I got a taste of life in Brussels. Just like in most of Central Europe, lunch takes place at noon, and it’s very common for people to have a sandwich with salad or soup—often eaten in the nearest park if the sun is out.  

### A Professionally Enriching Experience  

From a professional standpoint, attending one of the project review sessions at the European Commission offices was a remarkable experience. It gave me a sense of working on something significant at a European level. For me, even something as simple as having a temporary accreditation to access the premises was exciting in itself.  

Throughout the project, I became familiar with the entire development process, along with the periodic evaluations by the Commission, which helped me grow as an engineer.  

### Exploring the European Capital  

On a personal level, this trip allowed me to visit the European capital. Although the visit was brief, I still managed to see some of the must-visit landmarks, even within such a short timeframe.  

The *Grand Place* was, of course, a must-see. This iconic location hardly needs an introduction. No matter where you look within the square, you’ll find impressive historic monuments. As expected, during my visit, the square was bustling with people—locals commuting to and from work, tourists (like myself) wandering around, and of course, cameras in hand capturing every moment.  

### A Walk Through the Heart of Brussels  

Once in the city center, it’s easy to get lost in the streets around the *Grand Place* while searching for the famous *Manneken Pis*. Luckily, there are signs in the surrounding streets that make it easier to find.  

On my way, I came across numerous shops selling typical Belgian delicacies—waffles and the world-renowned Belgian chocolate. From luxury brands like *Godiva* to smaller neighborhood stores offering samples of their delicious chocolate fountains, there was no shortage of tempting options.  

After a pleasant walk through the city center, tasting a few exquisite Belgian chocolates and doing some shopping, I finally found the *Manneken Pis*.  

This time, the little statue was in its natural state, without any costumes. Apparently, it’s a common tradition to dress it up in various outfits for local celebrations and special events. It took me a while, but I finally managed to snap a picture without any tourists' heads in the frame!  

### Hidden Gems and Unexpected Discoveries  

During my stroll, I came across a bronze statue of Christ. At the time, I had no idea what it was, but after looking it up later, I found out it was the *Everard Serclaes* monument. There was a steady stream of tourists taking photos and rubbing the statue’s arm—apparently, it brings good luck.  

I continued walking until I reached some gardens, whose name I didn't know at the time (one of the downsides of not having a travel guide). Later, I discovered that they were the *Mont des Arts* gardens. This spot is highly recommended—not just for its greenery but also for the breathtaking panoramic views of the city.  

### Ending the Visit with a Belgian Tradition  

I couldn’t leave Brussels without trying a local beer, so on my way back to the hotel, I stopped at a terrace and enjoyed a *Duvel* beer while watching the last rays of sunlight fade away.  

### A Reason to Return  

As you can tell, I missed out on visiting many of Brussels’ attractions. But given the limited time I had before my return, I managed to see quite a bit. That being said, it's a perfect excuse to come back one day—to visit the *Atomium* and many other places I couldn’t see this time around.  

I highly recommend visiting Brussels! The city is spectacular, and its excellent location makes it an ideal base for visiting other famous European cities like *Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp,* and *Liège*—all just a short trip away.
