I'm going to start this blog by dedicating my first post to the so-called MOOCs, or in Spanish, cursos abiertos online y masivos (massive open online courses). Many people reading this article probably already know what they are, but for those who don’t, here’s a reference to [wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_Open_Online_Course).

Why talk about MOOCs?
Because in recent months, I’ve noticed that more and more of these platforms are emerging (I’ll list them below). So much so that just a week ago, I found and enrolled in an Android course on the MiriadaX platform, which is essentially a Spanish-language MOOC portal.

Pros and cons of this type of learning:

- Pros: Almost all are free. Since they’re online, each student can manage their own schedule and access the course whenever and wherever they want (as long as they have an internet connection).

- Cons: You won’t receive an official certificate upon completion. At most, you may get a document stating that you completed the course, but its validity is questionable since it’s difficult to verify that the person taking the course is actually who they claim to be. (Perhaps the use of digital certificates would help, but even then, additional measures would be needed.)

Going back to the title of this article, the question is somewhat rhetorical, as it's impossible to predict the evolution of these tools. However, one thing is certain: universities and in-person learning centers will never become obsolete because of MOOCs. Still, MOOCs are another great option, especially in today’s world where higher education is becoming increasingly expensive and difficult to access.

In fact, in the future—when MOOCs are more widespread and gain global recognition—I believe that students who follow a well-structured MOOC learning path could be just as well-prepared for the job market as those who attend in-person institutions.

From a practical perspective, while most of the material covered in these courses is already available online in some form, the real appeal of MOOCs is that they curate and present information in a structured, didactic way. This allows anyone, for free, at any time, from anywhere, to simply start learning.

In short, MOOCs open doors for people who want to learn and expand their knowledge but cannot attend in-person courses for various reasons—whether it's scheduling conflicts, limited class availability, or financial constraints. Ultimately, the only limit to how much you can learn is the one you set for yourself.

Another major advantage is that, given Spain’s current economic situation and high unemployment rates, MOOCs are a great option for those who have lost their jobs. They provide an opportunity to gain new skills and retrain—requiring only a computer and an internet connection—while maintaining flexibility for job hunting or other commitments.

I’m writing this article in hopes that it helps anyone eager to learn. To make it more useful, here’s a list of all the MOOC platforms I know of so far:

**In Spanish:**
- **MiriadaX:**  So far, this is the only Spanish-language MOOC platform I know of. It’s relatively new, having launched on February 1st. As I mentioned, I’ve enrolled in an Android course here. What makes this platform unique is that it’s backed by a network of Spanish and Latin American universities (Universia), which ensures a certain level of quality in the course content.

Overall, it’s a solid platform. The only thing I miss is the ability to create structured learning paths that could lead to a master's degree or even—why not?—a full university degree. But I imagine that’s something they may introduce over time.

My personal experience has been positive so far. Considering it’s a newly launched platform with 50,000 students enrolled, I haven’t encountered any major issues. Registration is simple, and enrolling in a course is even easier.

Each course module is designed to be completed in three weeks. Right now, courses have fixed start and end dates. However, I believe that, since this is an online platform, it would make more sense to allow students to enroll whenever they want and have their enrollment date determine the start of the course. Otherwise, if someone discovers an Android course a month after enrollment closes, they’ll have to wait for the next session.

As for certification, it’s still unclear whether they’ll offer any official recognition. But let’s be honest—most people take these courses not to add them to their résumés, but simply to learn. (Though if they did provide a certificate, that would be a great bonus!)

**En inglés:**

- **theWEU**

[The World Education University](https://www.theweu.com/):  is a MOOC platform created in the United States that hasn’t launched yet, but it looks very promising. They already have a catalog of upcoming courses, master’s programs, and even full university degrees. (Yes, you read that right—university degrees!). The range of courses is impressive, and if it delivers on its promises, it could be a fantastic option for anyone in the world with internet access. It’s expected to launch in early February, so we’ll have to see how it performs.

**Coursera**

Coursera is essentially the English-language equivalent of MiriadaX. It consists of 33 universities (mostly English-speaking, with a few French institutions as well).

I haven’t personally used this platform yet, but it’s the oldest of the three listed here, and consequently, it has the largest student base—around 2.5 million, according to their website.

Coursera offers a wide range of courses across multiple disciplines. They do provide a certificate upon course completion, though I’m not sure how widely recognized it is.

**Conclusion**
As you can see, MOOCs are growing rapidly, offering valuable knowledge at the best price—free! And with the most flexible schedule—whatever works best for you.

I’m sure there are other MOOC platforms I haven’t mentioned, but I believe the ones listed here are the most well-known.
