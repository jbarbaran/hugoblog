One of my hobbies is watching TV series and movies (both in theaters and at home). At the end of the year, all sorts of recaps appear, showing the movies and shows you’ve watched, which ones you liked the most, etc.

For me, though, if I try to remember everything I’ve watched, I end up spending a long time just thinking about it. That’s where my need arises: is there an app for mobile or computer where I can log the movies and series I’ve seen and even rate them? Of course! There must be hundreds, but finding one that actually works for me has been a challenge. Here’s a list of the apps I’ve tried (note: all are for Android, and all are free or have a free plan):

- **[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/):** This is a social network where you can rate the movies you’ve watched. I tried it—it’s well-designed, works smoothly, but… what about TV series? That’s why I decided it wasn’t the best option. For the same reason, I ruled out other apps like Moviebase, SeriesGuide, and Cinetrak.

- **[IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/):** This app allows you to track both movies and TV series and works well. Based on your ratings, it recommends content you might like. However, after testing it, I found it a bit difficult to generate a list of all the movies and series I watched throughout the year.

- **[JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/es):** The biggest advantage of this app is that, in addition to letting me rate movies and series, it also provides recommendations for content I might enjoy. A great feature is that it tells you which platform each movie or show is available on. Like any app, it’s not a perfect fit for my preferences since it’s not a social network, but it’s the closest to what I was looking for.

For now, JustWatch is the winner, but I’ll keep looking to see if I find another app that I like even more.

Do you know of any other apps that meet my needs? I’d love to hear your suggestions in the comments!
