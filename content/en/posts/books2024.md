![Image of books I read in 2024](/images/books2024.webp)

This year, as a New Year's resolution, I’ve decided to read more (than in previous years). Achieving this isn’t too difficult since I don’t usually read much, so the goal I’ve set for myself is to read 5 books this year. It may seem like a small number, but for me, it will mean establishing a good habit.

And here’s the list of books I’ve selected to read (at least for now):

### [Think Like a Monk: Train Your Mind for Peace and Purpose Every Day. *Jay Shetty*.](https://www.amazon.es/Piensa-como-monje-interior-Divulgaci%C3%B3n/dp/8425358027)
This is the book I’m currently reading and the first of the year. I’m already three-quarters of the way through, and it’s great! However, there are paragraphs I need to read twice to fully grasp all the lessons inside. It’s highly, highly recommended.

### [The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win. *Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford*.](https://www.amazon.es/Phoenix-Project-Devops-Helping-Business/dp/1942788290/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2IIFQZGW86WCA&keywords=The+Phoenix+Project%3A+A+Novel+about+IT%2C+DevOps%2C+and+Helping+Your+Business+Win&qid=1706785440&sprefix=the+phoenix+project+a+novel+about+it+devops+and+helping+your+business+win%2Caps%2C284&sr=8-1)
This was a Christmas gift and a book I’ve wanted to read for a long time. Apparently, it humorously illustrates the conflict between Dev and Ops and how DevOps emerges from it.

### [Deep Work. Rules For Focused Success In A Distracted World. *Cal Newport*.](https://www.amazon.es/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/0349411905/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2OUTYY2AFA9JP&keywords=deep+work&qid=1706785495&sprefix=deep%2Caps%2C97&sr=8-2)

I’m eager to read this book because, even though it seems obvious, staying focused while working is quite difficult nowadays.

### [La sombra del viento. *Carlos Ruiz Zafón*.](https://www.amazon.es/Sombra-Viento-Biblioteca-Carlos-Zaf%C3%B3n/dp/8408163434/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2QSWNWYP6QIAZ&keywords=la+sombra+del+viento&qid=1706786598&sprefix=la+sombra+del+%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-1)

Not everything has to be about learning, so I’ve chosen this super famous novel. Everyone who reads frequently recommends it to me. The thing is, I started it years ago but didn’t get hooked—so I’m giving it another chance!

### [Catching fire. The Hunger Games 2. *Suzanne Collings*.](https://www.amazon.es/Catching-Fire-Hunger-Games-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B006NXI58M/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1L8Q1I06PHRPV&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LT8bmE3VsNJlwvgFe0-eoe5KQ8DBoT3HD9G9fLCb60vv-Qq2SbY3Xd44ClYuRD0kzoTCZWtT-MgapvsK9wOBOQMlIvYR_pf51yxLXshYZ6V2QTpARkP_ufki2aWqklaSFW8KZQcm-IBuK5LHB2iCBcxeKF-WjTRyZiPQalxXcYxsd0MZgQnzGPyo5eTpOmJy2L8Orxpcs3xvXVror0pWsOgp4idqgrLvQdnK5p-zxpIlFNr2FyeJ3lVZvT2kFr8gwOMKewNgOYDZQBCu0qYbzjHjOtngnEJzFRzRYY-ViR5gA3gC0Re-xynOHBXx51FvIRKDSdkINTrv5WLciml51b0GdbgyoKDegBF6ofQhZDS30j7tReOW91r-0tr1EjqO8d9zb3N57VWE0Nn2ZeaA5cMibXN_ORx2eySzpqJEZQ7XoBwnyZxBM771_38jjjb8.AaYQNcyv9QctZC5xfuMvGPx3ygDjLv-E7i7BG3JI30Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=hunger+games+catching+fire&qid=1738876460&sprefix=hunger+games+catching+%2Caps%2C123&sr=8-1)

I bought the trilogy and read the first two books, but then I watched all the movies, and reading the final book lost a bit of its charm since I already know how it ends. However, I don’t like leaving a series unfinished, so I’m going to read it.

That’s it! This is my reading commitment for the year. By the end of 2024, I’ll post an update, and it’ll also be on my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110068486-javier-barbaran) profile.

And what about you? What are you planning to read this year?
